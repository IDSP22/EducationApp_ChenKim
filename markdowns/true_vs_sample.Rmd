# True vs. Sample Odds Ratio

&nbsp;

In most of case-control or cohort studies, sample population used to calculate the odds ratio is not the TRUE representative of the entire population. In this case, calculated odds ratio is the approximation of the true odds ratio.

### Letâ€™s go back to the previous example:

Beyonce and Jay-Z decided that they need to report this incidence to the health authority and launch a larger-scale investigation. Given the large number of people who attended the party, health authority decided to draw a subset of attendants to investigate their food consumption history and the presence of illness to draw inference on the entire party guests. See how the estimated odds ratio changes as you draw random samples of attendants from the party guests. The exposure and symptom status of the entire party guests (provided in the table on the right) are not known to the investigators.
