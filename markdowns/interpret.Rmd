# Interpretation of Results

&nbsp;

Confidence interval for OR does not report a measure’s statistical significance. In practice, the 95% (or any specific level of) CI is often used as a proxy for the presence of statistical significance __if it does not overlap the null value (e.g. OR=1).__ 

Nevertheless, it would be __inappropriate__ to interpret an OR with 95% CI that spans the null value as indicating evidence for lack of association between the exposure and outcome.

* __Example 1)__ the odds of persistent suicidal behaviour in the group given presence of borderline personality disorder at baseline was twice that of depression (OR 3.8, 95% CI:1.6–8.7), and was statistically significant (p 0.002)
* __Example 2)__
