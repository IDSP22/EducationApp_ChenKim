# Interpretation of Results

&nbsp;

Confidence interval for OR does not report a measure’s statistical significance. In practice, the 95% (or any specific level of) CI is often used as a proxy for the presence of statistical significance __if it does not overlap the null value (e.g. OR=1).__ 

Nevertheless, it would be __inappropriate__ to interpret an OR with 95% CI that spans the null value as indicating evidence for lack of association between the exposure and outcome.
