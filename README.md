Education App Simulation Based on BOAST Odds Ratio By Yuyu(Ruby) Chen (yc4178@nyu.edu) &amp; Sooyoung Kim (sk9076@nyu.edu)

This application guides you through the concept of odds ratio (OR), a measure of association between an exposure and a categorical outcome.
Through this app, you will learn:

* Definition of odds ratio
* How to calculate odds ratio
* When it is used
* True vs. Sample odds ratio 
* Confidence interval of the sample odds ratio
* How to interpret the result

At the end of this app, you will be able to upload your own choice of dataset to calculate and interpret the odds ratio that you're interested in. The data needs to contain at least 2 dichotomous variables (for now). If you don't have such data, there's an example dataset in the "data" folder called "WaffleDivorce_2.csv".
