Education App Simulation Based on [BOAST Odds Ratio](https://shinyapps.science.psu.edu) By Yuyu(Ruby) Chen (yc4178@nyu.edu) &amp; Sooyoung Kim (sk9076@nyu.edu)

### Overview

This application guides you through the concept of odds ratio (OR), a measure of association between an exposure and a categorical outcome.
Through this app, you will learn:

* Definition of odds ratio
* How to calculate odds ratio
* When it is used
* True vs. Sample odds ratio 
* Confidence interval of the sample odds ratio
* How to interpret the result

At the end of this app, you will be able to upload your own choice of dataset to calculate and interpret the odds ratio that you're interested in. The data needs to contain at least 2 dichotomous variables (for now). If you don't have such data, there's an example dataset in the "data" folder called "WaffleDivorce_2.csv". 


### Thoughts behind the application design

* We designed the app to be a step-by-step guided learning experience for those who are not familiar with the concept of odds ratio. Each page contains a paragraph or two of theory followed by quizzes to validate their newly acquired knowledge.
* We used toy example throughout the app to help the users understand the concept clearly with the applied example in real life, as well as to ensure the continuity of the narrative.
* We also added a page at the end of the app for users to upload their own data to apply the learned concept outside the context of toy example.
